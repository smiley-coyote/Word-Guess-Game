# Jukebox Hangman

## Welcome to Jukebox Hangman!

Please note: this game was created when I had the most basic knowledge of JavaScript.
I hadn't yet understood objects, which would have made the code much cleaner and easier
to update and add songs. I decided to leave this as is to show how my understanding
of the language evolved week by week. (View my next projects - Avatar RPG and What's My Line? to see how my logic progressed)

## How to play
* Click the 25 cents button to insert a quarter
* Start guessing letters to reveal the song title
* You may use the hint button to reveal the artist at any time for no extra cost
* You cannot miss 3 in a row, otherwise the jukebox has to reset
* Once you select all of the correct letters to the song, the jukebox will play that song

Have fun playing and enjoy the music!
